# Axioms of Manufacturing Topology

## Definition of Variables
* **$O$ (Complexity):** The friction coefficient of information flow within the organization.
* **$N$ (Nodes):** Any discrete operational element (Sensor, PLC, SCADA, ERP, User).
* **$t$ (Bifurcation Time):** The moment where $Cost(Integration) > Value(Data)$.

## Axiom I: Sequential Point-to-Point
$$Complexity \approx \frac{N(N-1)}{2}$$
* **Type:** Polynomial Growth ($O(N^2)$)
* **Outcome:** Structural Incoherence.

## Axiom II: Geometric Unified Namespace
$$Complexity = N$$
* **Type:** Linear Growth ($O(N)$)
* **Outcome:** Structural Coherence.

## Axiom III: The Relocation of the Exponent
The transition from I3.0 to I4.0 is defined by the movement of the exponent ($^2$) across the operator:

$$Shift: [Constraint] \rightarrow [Capacity]$$

This confirms that Industry 4.0 is not a software upgrade, but a **Topological State Change**.
